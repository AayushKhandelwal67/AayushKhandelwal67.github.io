### In the above Diabetes Dataset, based on some attributes, we are trying to predict the likelihood of Diabetes Risk for any patient. The attributes of dataset are as follows: 
#### Id: Unique Identifier 
#### Pregnancies: Number of Pregnancies. 
#### Glucose: Glucose Level (Glucose Tolerance Test) 
#### Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). 
#### Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm). 
#### Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml). 
#### BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg / height in m^2). 
#### DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Function that scores the probability of diabetes based on family history. 
#### Age: In years. 
#### Outcome: Binary classification indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes. 
Now to get to the prediction is a multi-step process which includes, Loading the Dataset, Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, Splitting of Data into Training and Testing, Exploratory Data Analysis for getting useful insights, Model Creation and Training, Prediction and Evaluation and Dashboards using Data Visualization. Hence this dataset will help doctors to make the patients know about the risk of diabetes using some health attributes.
