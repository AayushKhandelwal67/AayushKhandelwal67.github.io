# [Healthcare Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes)
### In the above Diabetes Dataset, based on some attributes, we are trying to predict the likelihood of Diabetes Risk for any patient. The attributes of dataset are as follows: 
#### Id: Unique Identifier 
#### Pregnancies: Number of Pregnancies. 
#### Glucose: Glucose Level (Glucose Tolerance Test) 
#### Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). 
#### Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm). 
#### Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml). 
#### BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg / height in m^2). 
#### DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Function that scores the probability of diabetes based on family history. 
#### Age: In years. 
#### Outcome: Binary classification indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes. 
Now to get to the prediction is a multi-step process which includes, Loading the Dataset, Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, Splitting of Data into Training and Testing, Exploratory Data Analysis for getting useful insights, Model Creation and Training, Prediction and Evaluation and Dashboards using Data Visualization. Hence this dataset will help doctors to make the patients know about the risk of diabetes using some health attributes. 


# [Deep Learning Book By Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
## The Deep Learning Book is divided into 3 parts to cater to different audiences.

#### The first part gives us the knowledge of Applied Mathematics and Fundamentals of Machine Learning and these both are importat before deep diving into Deep Learning. 

#### The second part of the book is most important in terms of Deep Learning because it consists of knowledge about different Neural Networks like Convolutional neural network & Recurrent neural network. It also includes important concepts like Regularization and Optimization. Also, it tells us the important applications of it in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and other areas. 

#### The third and last part of the book describes more hypothetical ideas that are widely believed to be important for future research in deep learning. This section is important for researchers.
